//! Getting the app back in front, and knowing when a game has ended.

//! * `bring_to_front`: after a Windows folder / file window closes, or when a
//!   game ends, the app's window becomes the foreground window again, so the
//!   controller keeps working without touching the mouse or keyboard.
//!   (Windows only lets the foreground app hand the foreground over; the usual
//!   way round it is used: a tap of Alt, and attaching to the foreground
//!   window's input for the call.)
//! * Game mode: while a game runs, `in_game()` is true (the controller reader
//!   sends nothing and the app idles). `watch_game` follows the game: the
//!   process that was started, any program running from the game's folder,
//!   and the window that comes to the front after the launch. When all of
//!   them are gone, the app is told ("game-exited") and brought back.
